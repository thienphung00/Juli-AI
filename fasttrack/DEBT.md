# Debt — repay before merging into main

Every skipped gate or shortcut. Format: `- [ ] what — why skipped — how to repay`.

## Gates skipped by design (D4, D8)

- [ ] `pr.yml` does not run on this branch (typecheck, architecture/import-linter,
  bandit, nginx lints, demo/landing e2e, artifact gates, full regression,
  performance smoke) — speed — run the full `pr.yml` suite on the merge PR and
  fix what it finds.
- [ ] No Executor/Review artifacts, validators or ADRs — speed — write one ADR
  summarising DECISIONS.md D1–D19 before merge.
- [ ] `.claude` edit hooks and executor-cache pre-commit gate disabled —
  speed — restore `.claude/settings.json` hooks and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
  entry from `main` in the merge PR.
- [ ] `fasttrack-deploy.yml` refuses SHAs that would redeploy `apps/demo`,
  `apps/landing`, `packages/` or `pnpm-lock.yaml` (those lanes need a
  `release.yml` build artifact) — fast-track frontend changes can't be deployed
  until merge, or until the workflow builds those artifacts itself.
- [ ] Deploy leaves the VPS clone `~/Juli-AI-v2` detached at the fast-track SHA
  — `release.yml`/`rollback.yml` re-checkout `main` first, but verify after the
  first fast-track deploy.
- [ ] Backup thresholds (≥1 MB, ≥10 TABLE DATA entries) are guesses — tune
  after the first real backup.
- [ ] `release.yml` release artifact / browser checks / GitHub release not
  produced for fasttrack deploys — speed — first deploy from `main` after merge
  runs the full release.
